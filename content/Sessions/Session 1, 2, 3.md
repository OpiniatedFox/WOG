## Session 1

The party had gotten a quest from someone by the name of [[Old man Harvey]], or at least that's what the locals call him. His daughter seems to be missing, and wishes to call upon some newbie adventurers to help. Calling upon:
- [[Delta Northstar]]
- [[Swiver CaCaw]]
- [[Dundee]]
- [[Yanni]]
- [[Ignis Mors]]

With that, they arrive one by one, to [[Old man Harvey]]'s home outside the village of [[Mordylehaven]].

[[Delta Northstar]] and [[Swiver CaCaw]] have an awkward conversation as they ride to [[Old man Harvey]]'s home, being the last to show up upon getting to his house. (Minus [[Yanni]] who seems to not have shown up for some mysterious reason.)

With [[Dundee]] and [[Ignis Mors]] waiting, they don't really talk much, no matter how much [[Dundee]] attempts, making [[Ignis Mors]] uncomfortable and uninterested in him.

Once the other two arrive, [[Dundee]] getting impatient on waiting on the last person to show up, just knocked on the door of [[Old man Harvey]] and he greets them.

[[Old man Harvey]] gives them the run down, that a group of bandits have stolen his daughter and he needs them to get her back.

[[Delta Northstar]] questions him a little more, trying to get more info out of him, but ends up frustrating [[Old man Harvey]] instead, revealing the name of his daughter [[Ulisa]], and the bandits have a camp somewhere out North East, and nothing more.

[[Dundee]] requests Tim-Timms, but is denied.

They leave with more questions then real answers, but before they leave, [[Ignis Mors]] gets impatient and feeling the need to burn something casts bonfire on [[Old man Harvey]]'s cart.

[[Old man Harvey]] hears the commotion and see's his cart burning. He's about to attack [[Ignis Mors]], but [[Delta Northstar]] is able to convince him otherwise, instead halving all of their pay.

[[Swiver CaCaw]] puts out the fire.

As the newly formed group think about what they could do, [[Dundee]] hears a slight whisper calling for help. He assumes it came from the same direction as the bandits and heads that way.

The group follow, as [[Dundee]] gets them lost. But thanks to [[Swiver CaCaw]]'s natural senses, they are able to lead them towards a small camp, watching over [[Old man Harvey]]'s home.

[[Delta Northstar]] and [[Dundee]] approach the group, who get's defensive as soon as they see the group of adventurers.

The bandits promise they can explain everything, but are getting nervous by the fact that [[Old man Harvey]] hired them and still not knowing their character.

A fight almost breaks out, as [[Dundee]] squares up to one of the men, attempting to defend [[Delta Northstar]] in his own way.

[[Delta Northstar]] defuses the situation, and promises to hear them out. They accept, but first need to discuss something.

After a long discussion, and [[Swiver CaCaw]]'s failed attempt to find shinny's, The bandits approach the party, saying they must talk to their captain who is back at their base. Leading them will be [[Ben the Bandit]], or benny boy as they call him.

The party warily agree.

During the long talk to the bandit camp, [[Ben the Bandit]] is very clearly nervous and shaking a bit. [[Swiver CaCaw]] is able to calm him down with some nuts, and [[Delta Northstar]] strikes up a conversation with him.

[[Ben the Bandit]] tells the party that, their captain [[Luke]] is actual a very nice guy, who only wishes to see adventurers thrive. Part of why they've formed the group they are in now. He says without them, he would never be as happy as he is now, and is happy to apart of [[The Bandits of Heroes]].

Once they arrive, they are met with what seems to be an old temple of [[Salvator the god of protection and safety]].

They are lead into the back where [[Luke]] as a private conversation with [[Ben the Bandit]]. During which [[Dundee]], walks into the [[The Bandits of Heroes]] holding cells, and a brawl almost starts before [[Luke]] calms everything down and motions for the group to come inside the back of the base.

[[Luke]] explains that he knows nothing of [[Old man Harvey]]'s daughter but he does know why he sent the party this way. During a bad deal gone wrong where [[The Bandits of Heroes]] aren't able to find everything he needs, he refuses to pay them. So [[Ben the Bandit]] steals the doll in desperation. [[Sir Nithalor Pensivous]] their local mage see's some magic on it and wishes to dispel it. He ask's for the party to let him dispel it, and they can take the doll back to [[Old man Harvey]] and be done with this.

[[Delta Northstar]] thinks this is a horrible idea and completely disagrees with dispelling the magic on the doll. Fearful of whatever could happen.

[[Ignis Mors]] casts some magic and doesn't sense any bad magic, and thinks they should let [[Sir Nithalor Pensivous]] do his thing. The rest of the party agree. [[Delta Northstar]] relents. 

[[Sir Nithalor Pensivous]] is successful, and it is reveled the doll was a bag of holding, holding some magic items, gold, and a bloody note reading:

#### Bloody Note
	My Dearest Ulisa,
	
	With quill in hand and heart laid bare, I inscribe these words to thee, in the hope that they may reach thee and find favor in thy sight. Know that it is with a soul enraptured by the gentle radiance of thy presence that I dare to pen this for you, for my heart beats as if in a dance whenever thy name graces my thoughts.
	
	Fair maiden, like the finest jewel adorning the crown, thou art a beacon of grace and beauty in this world of shadows. In thy presence, the very air seems to shimmer with ethereal light, and all else pales in comparison to the...[UNREADABLE]...
	
	From the moment our paths first crossed, my spirit recognized in thee a kindred soul, and with each passing day, that recognition has blossomed into an all-consuming ardor. [UNREADABLE]..., as untamed and resplendent as the wildest of roses in bloom.
	
	Yet, though I am but a simple farmer, I find myself at a loss to express the depth of my affection for thee. For in thee, I see not only the object of my desire, but also the embodiment of all that is virtuous...[UNREADABLE]...purity and grace, a vision of loveliness that hath ensnared my heart with an unyielding grip.
	
	Therefore, I beseech thee, dear Ulisa, to grant me the boon of thy favor, that I may bask in the warmth of thy affection as a weary traveler seeks refuge in the shelter of a welcoming hearth. For in thee, I find solace and sanctuary from the trials and tribulations of this mortal coil, and I would gladly lay down my life to ensure thy happiness and well-being.
	
	I declare my love for thee, Ulisa, and pray that thou wilt deign to accept it with the same boundless generosity with...[UNREADABLE]...
	
	Yours, now and forevermore,
	
	Pr[UNREADABLE]
#### End of Bloody Note

The party take the note and the doll. Leaving [[Dundee]] with the doll, and seeing no other reason to stay, they head out. Thanking [[The Bandits of Heroes]] for their help. They are a little hesitant on what to do as they leave, and decide to camp out for the night.

During the night [[Ignis Mors]] seems a little more out of the way than the others, attempting to sneak away, failing horribly.

[[Delta Northstar]] and [[Swiver CaCaw]] attempt to reassure him it's fine that he can sleep with the rest of them, but [[Ignis Mors]] refuses. [[Delta Northstar]] casts his owl familiar and has it watch over [[Ignis Mors]], no matter how much [[Ignis Mors]] attempts to hide from the owl.

During the day, they decide to head to the town, to figure some more information out. [[Swiver CaCaw]], heads to the town center in hopes of finding someone she can connect with. [[Ignis Mors]] and [[Delta Northstar]] head to the library. [[Dundee]] heads to the local tavern to get into a fight, as he's getting bored of all this talking.

[[Swiver CaCaw]] meets up with an old friend [[John Doe]], and asks about [[Old man Harvey]]. He says he doesn't know much and never knew he had a daughter before this. He does say he's pretty creepy and occasionally will hear music coming from his place. [[Swiver CaCaw]] spends the rest of their time, helping him sell to the locals.

[[Delta Northstar]] and [[Ignis Mors]] talk with the old lady librarian. [[Delta Northstar]] asks about [[Ulisa]] and she revels the girl went missing a couple of years ago. and someone by the name of [[Previs]] went missing some time ago as well. She personally thinks she eloped with him. She does know [[Previs]] used to work for [[The Bluetto Family]]. They thank the old lady and head back to meet up with the group.

[[Dundee]] gets kicked out of the tavern, and is no longer allowed inside.

## Session 2

As the party meet back up, they decide it's time to finally get something done about this. But are at two ends on what they should do about it.

[[Dundee]] just wants to return the doll and their payment, while [[Delta Northstar]] wants to find more information and piece things together a bit more.

During this conversation, they realize [[Ignis Mors]] has left the party to meet up with an old friend, and [[Yanni]] their late party member finally shows up to help them.

[[Yanni]] not really having much input, as she still believes their suppose to help this old man get his daughter back.

At the end, they decided to just follow [[Dundee]] as he marches his way to [[Old man Harvey]]'s house to get the job done.

Once arriving there they knock on his door, and he opens it. Excited to receive his "daughter" back, throwing them their payment, before quickly turning around and yelling at them in anger as soon as he realizes the doll has all it's enchantments removed. 

He lashes out and attacks the party. Almost killing [[Delta Northstar]].

In an attempt to calm him down, [[Delta Northstar]] throws him his journal at [[Old man Harvey]] to show him his finding. [[Old man Harvey]] picks the journal up, enters his house, locks the door, and summons a sprite to kill them, while he takes shots at them from within.

[[Dundee]] refuses to leave as he through his weapon earlier, and loses it for a bit. Not wanting to loose it. [[Yanni]] and [[Swiver CaCaw]] spend most of the time attempting to keep the two of them alive.

[[Delta Northstar]] attempts to burn [[Old man Harvey]]'s house, throwing the oil he had gotten from the doll on the side of the house, but is knocked out in the process. Once he gets back up, he flies up. 

[[Dundee]] having a one v one with the sprite learns his name to be [[Previs]] and just wants to be released. Eventually he is filled with fear and runs away, giving an excuse for the rest of the party to escape.

They take a walk of shame back to [[Mordylehaven]], learning the payment they have recived was fake and lost to an old man. They decide to rest up at [[Timmy's Bath and beyond]] for a small rest to figure out a plan.

Stumped on what they should do, as it dawns on [[Delta Northstar]] exactly what he lost.

## Session 3

[[Delta Northstar]] completely freaks out and demands for the rest of the party to rush back to [[Old man Harvey]]'s home. 

[[Swiver CaCaw]], and [[Dundee]] disagree, thinking they should go to [[The Bandits of Heroes]] for help to beat him. Thinking they have a better chance against him with some help.

[[Delta Northstar]] is adamant on his plan to burn his house down, and corner him within his own home. 

During this conversation [[Yanni]]. gets *busy busy* with someone from the bath house.

[[Ignis Mors]] returns, as the group leave the bath house, not wanting to wait on [[Yanni]]. [[Ignis Mors]] is all for the burning. Wanting to take any opportunity to burn something.

[[Swiver CaCaw]] deciding not really wanting to argue, and [[Dundee]] because he doesn't really care as long as he get's his chance to beat up [[Old man Harvey]]. [[Swiver CaCaw]] get's their friend [[John Doe]] to assist them in finding a large amount of oil from a local store, and are able to do so with ease.

The group head back to [[Old man Harvey]]'s home stealthily, and see the door open. [[Delta Northstar]] turns invisible and heads inside. [[Ignis Mors]] and [[Swiver CaCaw]] attempt to find birds to talk to, hoping they could know something. Unfortunately there are no birds minus [[Swiver CaCaw]].

[[Delta Northstar]] searches the place only to find nothing. The party begin to enter the home, and see [[Delta Northstar]] appear as he attempts to kick down a door. He fails.

[[Dundee]] takes over and kicks down the door with ease. [[Delta Northstar]] being impatient and still not thinking clearly throws down the oil and lits it. Much to [[Swiver CaCaw]]'s dismay and failure to stop them.

The group quickly heads down into the basement, but [[Ignis Mors]] stays behind to watch the flames.
