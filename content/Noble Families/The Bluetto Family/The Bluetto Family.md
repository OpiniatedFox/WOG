___

After the disappearance of [[The Deprave Family]], the Bluetto family swiftly took over the village of [[Mordylehaven]]. 

A very influential family, originating from the city of [[Broxit]] before leaving for unknown reasons, and ending up at [[Mordylehaven]]. A few years later, when the [[Demon Lord's Revival]] happens, the entirety of [[The Deprave Family]] disappears, and they quickly sort themselves into power, promising to locate [[The Deprave Family]] as long as they are seen as the temporary major of [[Mordylehaven]].

[[The Deprave Family]] was never found.
