A small village outside of most cities. Being a large lumber and farming village, most of the effects of the modern demon lord rising has little to zero effect on this village, minus the occasional monster attack that can easily be fought off with some help from local adventurers.

# Important History

Mordylehaven founded and ran by [[The Deprave Family]] before they mysteriously disappeared during the last Demon Lord revival. [[The Deprave Family]] was loved among the village and their disappearance was mourned throughout the village, and some still suspect foul play from the new major [[John Bluetto]].

Mordylehaven is now run by [[The Bluetto Family]] who took swift action after [[The Deprave Family]]'s disappearance. Many villagers suspect the family of **MAKING** [[The Deprave Family]] disappear, while others think they just took the opportunity of the disappearance to their advantage. 

While [[The Bluetto Family]] hasn't done much in ways of disturbing the average villager life they did rename the old distract of Depfacto to now be called the Bluetto Distract. Many where upset by this change and still refuse to call it by that name.
