Approaching this small camp the first thing your hear is the sound of people moving about, some laughter. Getting closer you see a group of people wearing standard leather equipment, equipped with a simple short sword. You see many inside of the camp, wondering, just seemingly resting at this point. One of the members seem to be writing something, and one stands guard looking out.
