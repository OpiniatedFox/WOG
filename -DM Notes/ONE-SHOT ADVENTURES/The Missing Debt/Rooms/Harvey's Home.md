## Main Room

A dusty and small little cabin in the woods. Walking inside you get the immediate smell of candles and incents that over power your noises. It's early quite, as not even the fire is on.

## Basement

Walking down the stairs into this old musky basement, your vision goes dark for a moment, before your eyes adjust to the light. The first thing you see is a gorgeous piano, perfectly clean. But before you can marvel at this beautiful instrument, you hear the soft melody of a girl crying. whispering "please help me... please... let me out... please" on repeat. looking towards you see a soft glow coming from a coffin that sits, chained up and locked. On the right you see a rotten corpse that looks like it's been there for years, at that moment is when the smell hits your noise hard. (make a DC 10 con save or else they throw up at the sight).
