___
What used to be a bunker and shelter for the followers of [[Salvator the god of protection and safety]] is now taken over by [[The Bandits]] and is being used as a way to keep their members hidden and safe.

## Guarded Entrance

You see a small wooden building that seems to be on the outside an abandoned old church from hundreds of years ago. Two guards stand by next to a wooden door, as they seem to be talking about life.

## Main Entrance

As you walk down the musty old building, cobwebs hitting your face as your party walk down the stairs. once you reach the floor, you see torches lined up, and an old statue that sits in the corner of the room. (DC 14 religion check will reveal that is a statue of the god [[Salvator the god of protection and safety]])

## Main Hall

Walking into the what seems to be some kind of mess hall, you find some tables, a counter with what seems to be cooking equipment and a piano in the corner for entertainment. 

## Training Room

Coming down from the main hall, you see a room, with worn in dummies, and a bit of blood splattered on the guard. in the corner of the room seems to be some standard short swords and some arrows.

## Jail Room

As you approach the door, you can hear someone grumbling and muttering to himself. (A DC 12 perception check will reveal that he is complaining about guarding an empty jail cell).

Walking inside you see a man sitting on a stool in the corner of the room, arms crossed, staring into what looks like empty cells filled with cobwebs and dust.

## Sleeping Quarters

This room, seems just to be a long hall way with makeshift beds put in place, many guards seem to be passed out, and sleeping peacefully.

## Treasure Room

As you enter this room, you see it filled with bags, and barrels of supplies. In the center of the room, you see a wizard focusing on what seems to be a doll, and a taller man in the corner watching him, almost dozing off.

## Escape Tunnel

A long tunnel filled with cobwebs and dust, and as you go further into the room, the smell of unused air and damp stone hits your noise. it's very unpleasant.
