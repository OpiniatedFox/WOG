Fell in love with a small time farm girl named [[Ulisa - DM Copy]], but was kept apart by their father. So one night they come up with a plan for [[Ulisa - DM Copy]] to run away from [[Old man Harvey]] and escape his abuse. They agreed upon a spot to meet at and while he waited for her, she never came.

In anger and certainty that [[Old man Harvey]] was the one who stole her from him, he barged into [[Old man Harvey]]'s home. Unfortunately he was no match for necrotic power of his magic, but instead of killing him, [[Old man Harvey]] did something worse...

For the rest of his life, he was chained up in the basement, tormented to listen to [[Ulisa - DM Copy]]'s screams, unable to do anything. he died next to his love, but she will never know he was there for her.

Before he knew of [[Ulisa - DM Copy]], he worked out for [[The Bluetto Family]] as their field hand. He was really close with the wife of [[John Bluetto]], [[Felicia Bluetto]]. while he was only supposed to help with their fields, he ended up helping a lot with [[Felicia Bluetto]]'s personal aid, which [[John Bluetto]] took notice and took a problem with that. Many of the rumors surrounding Previs' disappearance thinks [[John Bluetto]] killed him, or made him disappear like how they did with [[The Deprave Family]].
