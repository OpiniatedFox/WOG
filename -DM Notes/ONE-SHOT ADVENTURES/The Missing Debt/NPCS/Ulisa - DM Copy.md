___

The daughter of [[Old man Harvey]], who fell in love with [[Previs - DM Copy]]. Her father did not approve, and during the night she attempts to elope with [[Previs - DM Copy]], but she is caught by [[Old man Harvey]] who drags her down into his basement and chains her up into a coffin.

She screamed for days to be let out, but she was always drowned out by the sound of a piano, which drives her mad. Before eventually dying due to starvation.

## Undead
the whispers of her calling for help can still be heard from the basement. If the piano is played, this will drive her crazy and attack anyone and everyone living.

If spoken too, and told her father is dead, she will thank the party and will be set free. Finally able to rest.
