___

A group of adventurers are summoned to help [[Old man Harvey]].

## Basic Story
[[Old man Harvey]] recently hired the group known as [[The Bandits]] to help him collect some old items from an old ruin.

Once the job was complete, some of the items [[Old man Harvey]] requested wasn't there and while [[The Bandits]] tried to explain that there was never anything in there like that, [[Old man Harvey]] was still pissed and refused to pay them. So in an attempt to quickly get out of there with something, one of the younger members grabbed an old doll which [[Old man Harvey]] calls "his daughter" and ran. [[The Bandits]] swiftly left, but not before getting hit by a few of the old man's spells.

With his doll gone, he requested some help from a few newer adventurers in hope they won't question much and just get the job done. He promises to pay each of them ==**20 GP Each**==

#### Second Session
The party will need to have a talk with [[John Bluetto]] or [[Felicia Bluetto]]
 which they can request after talking with others within the [[Bluetto]] district. 

#### Third Session
Thanks to [[Delta Northstar - DM Notes]] giving his journal over, and the doll's spell being dispelled, [[Old man Harvey]] will go out and attack, the librarian, and the merchant resulting in their deaths in the night. He will also reanimate them, to have them attack the village.

([[Old man Harvey]] blames the village for forcing him to kill his own daughter)

Once they wake up, they will hear screaming coming from outside and the dead seem to be attacking, a couple of guards are dead, and the others seem to mainly be focusing on getting the villagers out. 

Delta and Swiver will recognize two of them, one being the librarian and the other their merchant friend.

If they talk to the guards, they will tell the party that, a couple of murders happened last night, and while they were transporting the bodies, they reanimated and attacked. They have no clue where they came from.

## Outcomes

### Giving Old man Harvey the doll back
If the party ends up giving [[Old man Harvey]] his doll back, with nothing missing from within and the spell intact, he will be ecstatic and will pay the party the amount promised. Quickly pushing them out of his home.

### Confronting Old Man Harvey about the unpaid work
He will claim they never finished the job he requested, and get quite defensive. If pushed he will refuse to pay the party, or only pay half as much if the doll is given back.

### Doll has been dispelled
Dispelling the arcane lock on the doll will reveal an endless void inside. Reaching your hand in, 232 GP can be pulled out, as well as 2 rolls of [Magic Table](https://5e.tools/lootgen.html) B and 2 rolls of [Magic Table](https://5e.tools/lootgen.html) A, and as well as a [[Bloody Note]].

### Attacking the Bandit hideout
If the party makes large noise and just attacks the camp, many of the guards will come out and defend the camp. [[Luke]] will have a group of bandits with him to defend the exit tunnel, and have [[Sir Nithalor Pensivous]] leave. 

If the party defeat [[Luke]], they will find [[Sir Nithalor Pensivous]] shaking and hiding in the exit tunnel, if he see's the body of [[Luke]] he will begin to cry.
