REPORT FROM CAMP OLD WATCH

Day 1
CAMP: Been quite for awhile, I haven't seen Harvey leave his house in awhile.

CAPTAIN: Keep an eye out, you never know what that old crazy bastard could be doing.

Day 3
CAMP: I think Harvey is up to something. I've seen him send out a courier out to [[T.A.L.K]]. I think we need to move soon. The old ruins might not be the best base choice of a base, expressly with Harvey knowing of it's location.

CAPTAIN: Just keep an eye out, for any adventurers maybe we can explain the situation if we can reach them first.

Day 4:
CAMP: Ben got sick, so we sent him to the nearby village to hopefully get some rest and not be stuck in this dusty old place. Nothing to note from Harvey. I've been hearing piano music coming from his house. I wonder if that means anything.

CAPTAIN: Once Ben is feeling better, send him back to base. I need to have a word with him. I don't remember seeing any piano in that old bastards house, could it be magic? Keep your ears plugged every time you hear that music, just to be careful.

DAY 7:
CAMP: We got a report from our scout, a group of random adventurers approaching Harvey's house, I think we should move as soon as possible. If Harvey tells them the location of our base this could end ba-[The rest is cut off, almost like he was interrupted]
