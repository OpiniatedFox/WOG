GUILD REQUEST FORM REQUEST TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF LEVELS AND KILLS

Guild Name: The Bandits of Heroes

Guild Master: Luke Baringstrong

G.M. Adventurer Rank: Rank 1

Reason for forming Guild: I wish to bring a safe environment for ranked adventurers. Too many guilds are focused on raising their standing causing them to send lower ranked adventurers on quests meant for higher ranked adventurers or sending a low amount of adventurers causing many to be killed in action.
